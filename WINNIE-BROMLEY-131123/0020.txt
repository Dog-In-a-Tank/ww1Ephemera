 When trouble comes, don't let despair
 Add the burden you must bear, 
But keep heart, and, smiling say, 
The darkest cloud must pass away

 Don't sit and brood over things gone wrong 
But sing a helpful little song, 
Or whistle something light and gay 
And whistle half your care away. 

The man who sings when trouble's here, 
From trouble has not much to fear, 
Since it will never tarry long, 
When stout heart meets it with a song. 

The don't forget when things go wrong, 
To try the magic in a song; 
For cheerful heart and smiling face
Bring sunshine to the shadiest place
