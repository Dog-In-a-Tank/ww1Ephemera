hurt as it may, love is, love for ever
 Love for Loves' sake, like the father above
But for whose brave hearted son
we had news known love
known the sweet heart of the sorrowful love
Thou knows saviour, its hurt and 
its sorrow
didst preserve its joy , bony he ,might 
of thy pain
Lord of all yesterdays, days and tomorrows,
Help us love on in the hope of Thy gain ;
But sun would not shine, nor waters go,
Snowdrop tremble, nor fair dove moan ,
God be on high, nor man below,
But for love
for the love with its hurt alone.
Oh,the hurt,the hurt,and the hurt of love
Wherever the sun shines, the waters go.
It hurts the snowdrop, it hurts the dove, 
God on His throne, and man below.
