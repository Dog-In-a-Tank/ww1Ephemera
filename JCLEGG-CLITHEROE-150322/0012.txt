Do not lose heart. Refuse to let 
yourself go. There is a breaking-point,
There lies danger, that you let
yourself go. You are tired of
holding on. Of course. Remember,
there is one ounce
more of resistance left in us
then we believe. It seems 
a pity not to use it. Why?
Because, if you use it, you
will come through ... and
out ... into the light.
