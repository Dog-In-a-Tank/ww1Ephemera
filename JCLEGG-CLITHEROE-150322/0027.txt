Lots of time for lots of things 
Though it's said that time has wings, 
There is always time to find
Ways of being sweet and kind ;

There always time to share 
Smiles and goodness everywhere
Tome to send the frowns away
Time a gentle word say. 

There is time for helpfulness and
Time to assist the weak to climb
Time to give a little flower 
Time for friendship any hour
But, there is no time to spare
for unkindess anywhere.
