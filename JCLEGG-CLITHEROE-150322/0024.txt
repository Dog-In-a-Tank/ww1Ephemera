The two kinds of people on earth I mean
are the people who lift and the people 
who lean 
wherever you go you will find the worlds 
masses
are always divided in first 
these two classes
and oddly enough, you will find, 
too, I ween
There's only one lifter to twenty 
who lean.
In which class are you? Are you 
easing the load
Of overtaxed lifters who toil down 
the road?

Or are you a leaner who lets 
others bear
Your portion of labor and 
worry and care?
