Two Ships 

There was a man, it was said one time. 
who went astray in his youthful prime
can the brain keep cool and the heart keep quiet
when the blood is a river that's running riots
and boys will be boys the old folks say. 
and the man is better who had his day. 
The sinner reformed and the preacher told
of the periodical son who came to the fold 
and christian people thew open their doors, 
with a warm welcome that ever before 
wealth and honour were his to command
and a spotless women gave him her had 
and the world strewer their pathway 
with blossoms boom

By 'God bless lady, and god bless groom!"
There was a maiden who went astray,
In the golden dawn of her life’s young day;
She had more passion and heart than head,
And she followed blindly where fond love led.
And love unchecked is a dangerous guide,
To wander at will by a fair girl’s side.
The woman repented and turned from sin ;
But no door opened to let her in.
The preacher prayed that she might be forgiven,
But told her to look for mercy—in heaven ;
For this is the law of the earth we know,
That the woman is stoned while the man may go.
A brave man wedded her after all ;
But the world said, frowning, “We shall not call.
