The Haven of Memory 
Gilbert Thomas

Every evening at set of sun
Silently stealing, one by one
come the Ships of the day that is done
to the Haven of Memory 

Ships of Pleasure, and Ships of Pain
Ships of losses and ships of gain
In they slide from the mist of the rain
of the souls uninteresting sea 

and have they anchor side by side
and thus for a few bridge hours hide
Till, while they slumber, a stealthy tide
Comes silently in from the sea

Then back at the Infinite must and rain
are swept the vessels of loss and gain 
and only the ships of pleasure remain
in the Haven of Memory
