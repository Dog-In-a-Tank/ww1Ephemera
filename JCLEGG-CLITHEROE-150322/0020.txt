Forget it 

When someone hasn't played the game, 
And you have had to take the blame, 

Don't turn around and do the same, 
Forget it; 

When trouble comes to you some day. 
You cannot cure or drive away, 
Don't let it fill you with dismay, 
Forget it; 

That frown you have for things awry, 

That rainy day or cloudy sky. 
Don't stand around and whine or 
sigh. 

Forget it; 

You'll be surprised to find it's true, 
Misfortune soon fades out of view 
And disappears, if only you 
Forget it.
