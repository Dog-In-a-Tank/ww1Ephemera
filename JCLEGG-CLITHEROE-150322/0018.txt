When you and I are weary 
our souls and spirits dreary 
With all the humdrum cases we meet 
along the workaday
When feet are often slipping 
a tumbling and a tipping 
and somehow all lives outlook
seems a trite dead and prey
Don't let us loose our cheerfulness, 
its sense a harmless turn
for laughter is a physia tune
When folks are feeling done! 

For course its easy singing when hills 
with chansons singing 
and nature's glad with jesting
and there's naught to make us sigh
But when the cloud banks bleaker
and faith begins to slacken 
Its very, very , very hard to sound 
brave minstrelsy  
But still its never hopeless, if you the funny side 
For laughter is a medicine of healing far and wide
