Why Live, when life is sad,
death only sweet ? 
why fight when closest fight
end in Defeat ?
Why Pray, when in purest prayer
dark thought assail ?
Why strive, and strive again
only to fail 

Live, There are many round needing 
thy care. 
Pray,There is one at hand helping thy prayer. 
Fight, for the love of God, not for renown. 
Strive, but in His great strength,
not in thy own. 


Why hope when life has proved 
Our best hopes vain
Why love when love is fraught 
with so much pain 
why not cool heart and brain
in the deep wave!
Why not lie down and rest, in the still grave 


Hope â€”there is heaven's joy 
laid up for thee. 
Love, for true love alone
outlives its agony. 
Fight, pray, and wrestle on,
loving God best
Then, when thy work is done,
lie down and rest.
