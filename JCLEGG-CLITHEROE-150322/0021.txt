Just Keep in Keeping on

If the day looks kinder gloomy,
An' your chances kinder slim!

If the situation's puzzlin'
An' the prospect's awful grim,

An' perplexities keep pressin'
Till all hope is nearly gone,

Jus' bristle up an' grit your teeth
An' keep on keepin' on.

There ain't no use in growlin'
An' grumblin' all the time,

When music's ringing everywhere
An' everything's a rhyme â€”

Jus' keep on smilin' cheerfully,
If hope is nearly gone,

An' bristle up an' grit your teeth,
And keep on keepin' on.
