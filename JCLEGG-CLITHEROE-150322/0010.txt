We long for great events, for impressing 
duties... We could make something
or our life, we think, if only we had
not such small, sordid cares and 
tasks ... we ask for heroic duties
but the duties that lie to our hand 
are heroic. The so-called heroic 
duties are, after all, often saver 
and therefore less heroic, then the 
common place trials that daily tell 
the staff of which we are made
