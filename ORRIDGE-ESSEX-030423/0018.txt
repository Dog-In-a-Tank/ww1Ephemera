When you wander at night
 heath the silver moonlight 
with the girt that you love and adore
- love shines is her eyes
Like stars in the skies
Should you feel you're becoming a bore

When you sit in the office
and pay day far off is 
You ache with the "flue" and feel sneezy
you much prefer snoring 
to writing or drawing 
Why then to be sure its quite easy 
to B Flat

When you go to a dance
and there's half a chance 
You sit out with your girl on the staircase
If her Pa comes along 
to see where shes gone
its best to clear off, its its bareface
