With a pair of scales before him, a rich man 
sat and weighed a piece of gold, a widow's all,
and unto her he said: 

"Your coin is not the proper weight, so take it 
back again. 

Or sell it _me for half its worth; it lacks a single grain."

With tearful eyes the widow said" Oh, weigh it, sir, once more,
I pray you be not so exact, nor drive me from 
the door."
 "Why. see yourself, it's underweight, your tears
 are no avail." 
The second time be tries it, it just bears 
down the scale; 
But little guessed that rich man, who held 
the gold so dear, 
"That the extra weight which bore it down 
had been the widow's tear.
