Ten little people full of glee 
Went to skate on the guilder gee 
School was over, and work was done, 
And all were ready for lots of fun.
Meinherr van Tromp, with his hat so gay,
cried, "Home with me, I'll show you they way!" 
But when they got there, the ice was so cold, 
His little new skates wouldn't take any hold. 
He wobbled in such a ridiculous fashion
That his eyes grew round with fear and passion 
He cried, "Skates are not for a well like me, I'll them off and go home to tea"
