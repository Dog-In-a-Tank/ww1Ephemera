Message addressed by His Majesty the King 
to Admiral Sir John Jellicoe 

August 7th 1914

At this grave moment in our national history I send to you, 
and through you to the officers and men of the fleets of
which you have assumed command, the assurance of my 
confidence that under your direction they will receive and 
renew the old glories of the Royal Navy, and prove
once again the sure shield of Britain and of her 
Empire in the hour of trial.
George RI.

Extract of Message from His Majesty the King to the Army 

I have implicit confidence in you, my soldiers. Duty 
is your watchword, and I know your duty will be
nobly done. I shall follow your every movement
with deepest interest, and mark with eager 
satisfaction your daily progress; indeed, your welfare 
will never be absent from my thoughts. I pray God
to bless you and guard and bring you back victorious
George RI.
