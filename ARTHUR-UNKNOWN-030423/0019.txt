Crystals of Wisdom

Thackeray

Cheer up! 'tis no use to be glum, boys,â€”'Tis written, since fighting begun,
That sometimes we fight and we conquer,
And sometimes we fight and we run.

You must not judge hastily or vulgarly of snobs: to do so 
shows that you are yourself a Snob. I myself have been taken for one.

Poor Harry in his distress asked help from his relations;
his aunt sent him a tract and her blessing: his uncle had
business out of town  

The world can pry out everything about us which
it has a mind to know. But then there is this 
consolation, which men will never accept in their
own cases, that the world doesn't care 

The world is a Looking-glass, and gives back to every
man the reflection of his own face. Frown at it, and it will 
in turn look souoly upon you; laught at it and with it, and it 
is a jolly, kind companion; and so let all young persons take
their choice.
