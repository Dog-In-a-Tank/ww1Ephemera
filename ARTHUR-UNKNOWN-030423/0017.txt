Lone Dog (By Irene Mccloud) 

a lean dog a keen dog a wild dog 
and lone
I’m a rough dog, a tough dog, hunting on my 
own;
I’m a mad dog, a bad dog, teasing silly 
sheep;
I love to sit and bay the moon, to keep 
fat souls from sleep.

I’ll never be a lap dog, licking dirty 
feet,
A sleek dog, a meek dog, cringing for my 
meat,
Not for me the fireside, the well-filled meat plate,
But sharp kick , and sharp stone, and cuff 
and kick, and hate.

Not for me the other dogs, running by 
my side,
Some have run a short time, but 
none of them 
would bide.
O Wide winds, and wild stars, and
the  hunger of the quest!
