Never Let Him Know

When you marry him, love him 
after you marry him, study him.
If he is honest, honour him 
If he is generous, appreciate him 
When he is sad, cheer hi, 
When he is cross, amuse him, 
When he is talkative, listen to him
When is is quarrelsome, ignore him
If he is noble, praise him 
If he is confident, encourage him
If he is secretive, trust him. 
If he is jealous, cure him. 
If he cares naught for pleasure, coax him. 
If he favours society, accompany him.
If he does you a favour, thank him.
When he deserves it, kiss him. 
Let him think how well you understand him
but never let him know that you ‘manage’ him.’
