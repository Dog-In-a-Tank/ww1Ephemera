The Inconvenient Age

1./ "your'e much to old " says father of a builder
when I fall 
When I was young and hurt myself, I never cried 
at all
Come be a little man my son, for now that 
you are here 

We dont expext to see you cry, or such 
baby trials

How often I ??? could
your very much to old 


2./ But when I want to take long walks, or 
sit up very late 
or cross the road all by myself 
to tommy me ???? gate 

your far to young my father cried, 
and very much to small 

Such things are not for little lads
just wait until you are tall 
Thats often on his tongue
"your've very much to small"

3./Its very inconvenient, when ages chop and change
and I am just to old anyone for all 
thats I ?????? ?

Where Im a man and have a son I've
made my mind up quote ! 
Mu little shall be the age 
that just ???? Right 
and I shall akaways say
"Oh yes my lad you may
