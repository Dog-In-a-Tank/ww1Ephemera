"Postman's Knock'

When I was just a flapper with a floppy ribbon bow, 
I simply hated Jimmy, and I often told him so
But nothing seemed to squash him,
and he hung round just the same, 
Especially at parties when they played a kissing-game

No matter how I sulked and frowned, he'd only laugh and mock
That boy would always choose me when it came to
 “Postman's Knock .”
But since I've put my hair up,my views have altered 
quite!
I met Lieutenant Jimmy at a party Boxing Night,
And though we played old-fashioned games of 
every sort and kind,
It's really rather funny, but I didn't seem to mind.
In fact, perhaps you've guessed it, and will
hear without a shock
That I whispered " Yes " to Jim behind the door 
at “ Postman's Knock .”
And now he's in the trenches,
or that's the last I've heard,
It's four whole weeks tomorrow since his letter
brought me word,
Altho'I've written heaps of times there hasn't come a line
I'm getting rather anxious for that soldier-man of mine.
I try to hold my head up, but my smiles are low in stock
Oh ,it's weary, weary waiting,Jimmy, for the postman's knock!
